\section{A Fully-Connected ANN Model}
Since FEM based models are computational expensive, we may wish to figure out whether
it exist a much simpler and faster map $f: T \to F_{\left\{ x,y,z \right\}}$.
\cite{Zhang2016Fast} proposed a two-layers fully connected ANN model with hand-crafted
feature extraction, then train this model by large amount of $(T \to F_{\left\{x,y,x\right\}})$ data
generated off-line by FEM based model. 
The ANN model achieved accuracy of $RMSE: 0.0779$ in the normed test set, and fast enough 
($300 TSVs / 0.06s$ @ 2.4 GHz, 1 core) to be applied
in runtime scenario due to simplicity of the ANN model they used.
