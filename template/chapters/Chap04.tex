\chapter{Conclusion and Future Work} \label{chap::conc}
In this work, we proposed a novel method to approximate the thermal stress value
from relevant temperature distribution.
Models used in this method are modified from modern convolutional neuron networks,
which could perform feature extraction automatically, make this method an
end-to-end procedure.
We experimentally validated the feasibility of such automatic feature extraction.
The models achieve quite high accuracy while maintain economic computation costs.

However, we have not explored all possibilities of these CNN models could do.
Since the data structure of 3D IC thermal distribution and stress is quite distinctive
to other areas' data, and we have already known the priori knowledge about them,
new network structure or target function specified to this task may be possible.
