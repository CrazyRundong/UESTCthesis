\chapter{Preliminaries}

In this chapter, we introduce the conceptions of three dimensional integrated circuits, its thermal behavior, 
basic convolutional neural networks and its optimize methods.

\section{Three Dimensional Integrated Circuits} \label{sec::3DIC}

As integrated circuits technology continuously improves its integration capabilities,
the limitation of traditional 2D IC becomes more obvious.
For example, integrated circuits are partitioned into functions blocks (as knows as ``tiles'')
which are interconnected using routing in parallel 2D planes.
With the scaling of the technology, these long lines
have become the speed-limiting factor on the chip, as well as a significant
source for power consumption. If the functional ``tiles'' on the
chip could be stacked in three dimensions, the chip area would be
reduced and much shorter interconnects between would result.

This idea of three dimensional integrated circuits (3D ICs) has been proposed of a long time \cite{Beyne20043D},
for it gets potential to alleviate some important performance limitations facing CMOS scaling 
and because it enables so-called heterogeneous integration \cite{Beyne2006Rise}.
As described in \cite{Beyne20043D}, the 3D stacked devices can be divided into three categories
by their level of interconnect hierarchy:
\begin{description}
    \item[3D-system-in-a-package] (3D-SIP) is the chip level stacking, which means the stacked
    dies are designed as a series of well-defined and pre-tested sub-blocks, 
    and the third dimensional connection density is quite low: the available 3D-interconnectivity 
    between two layers is typically only $2\sim5/mm$ along the perimeter of the device or $4\sim9/mm^2$
    when area array packages are used.
    
    \item[3D-system-on-a-chip] (3D-SoC) connects into a lower level: for systems which need a higher
    interconnectivity between each dies, 3D-SoC directly connect ``tiles'' in these dies rather than dies
    itself. These interconnections must behave as on-chip ``global wiring'' interconnects and thus have low
    resistance and capacitance, allowing for fast interconnects and/or low power interconnectivity.
    This requires a higher 3D connectivity, in the order of $100/mm^2$.
    
    \item[3D-integrated circuit] (3D-IC) is considered as a ``scaling-driven'' technology 
    which connects transistors themselves. The 3D connections are only local interconnections,
    The global on-chip interconnect layers on chip remain essentially 2D interconnect layers.
\end{description}

As reported in \cite{Olmen20083D}, 3D ICs with TSV structures have been successfully demonstrated, 
in which $Cu$ TSV process is inserted between contact and M1 of their reference $0.13 \mu m$ CMOS process on
$200mm$ wafers. 

\section{Thermal Behavior of 3D IC}

TSV structure introduced several thermal stress problem which harms the reliability of 3D ICs, due to
two major reasons:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $Cu$ TSV always get a higher thermal conductivity than wafers for their material used.
    Thus, large temperature gradient may appear in the areas around TSVs, which may
    introduce large thermal stress.
    \item A great mismatch of coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) around TSVs may also enlarge 
    the thermal stress. The CTE of $SiO_2$ is $4.15\times10^{-6}K^{-1}$, while
    $17\times10^{-6}K^{-1}$ to $Cu$. This is a four times mismatch.
    Even though the area around a TSV keep same temperature, $Cu$ TSV expands much more than
    wafer, which will lead to great stress and harm to IC stability.
\end{itemize}

Under the Cartesian coordinate, the stress in solid can be formulated as \cite{Chen2013Numerical}:
\begin{equation} \label{equ::f_xyz}
\left\{
    \begin{array}{rl}
    -f_x &={} k_x - \frac{E\alpha}{1-2\nu}\cdot\frac{\partial T}{\partial x} \\
    -f_y &={} k_y - \frac{E\alpha}{1-2\nu}\cdot\frac{\partial T}{\partial y} \\
    -f_z &={} k_z - \frac{E\alpha}{1-2\nu}\cdot\frac{\partial T}{\partial z}
    \end{array}
\right.
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation*}
\left\{
    \begin{array}{rl}
    k_x &= \mu \left( \frac{\partial^2u}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2u}{\partial y^2} + \frac{\partial^2u}{\partial z^2} \right) 
          + \left( \mu + \lambda \right) \left( \frac{\partial^2u}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2u}{\partial y \partial x} + \frac{\partial^2u}{\partial z\partial x} \right) \\
    k_y &= \mu \left( \frac{\partial^2u}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2u}{\partial y^2} + \frac{\partial^2u}{\partial z^2} \right) 
          + \left( \mu + \lambda \right) \left( \frac{\partial^2u}{\partial x \partial y} + \frac{\partial^2u}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2u}{\partial z\partial y} \right) \\
    k_z &= \mu \left( \frac{\partial^2u}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2u}{\partial y^2} + \frac{\partial^2u}{\partial z^2} \right) 
          + \left( \mu + \lambda \right) \left( \frac{\partial^2u}{\partial x \partial z} + \frac{\partial^2u}{\partial y \partial z} + \frac{\partial^2u}{\partial z^2} \right) \\
    \mu &= \frac{E}{2(1+\nu)} \\
    \lambda &= \frac{E\nu}{(1+\nu)(1-2\nu)}
    \end{array}
\right.
\end{equation*}
and $f_{\left\{ x,y,z \right\}}$ denotes the force in $x$, $y$ and $z$ directions, $E$ the elastic
modulus, $\nu$ the Poisson ratio, $\alpha$ the thermal expansion, $T$ the temperature, $\mu$ and
$\lambda$ the Lam\'e coefficients. Note that in practical scenarios, $f_z$ is always $0$ so we may
pass the evaluation of $f_z$ to accelerate the simulation \cite{Marella2015A}.

\ref{equ::f_xyz} is the theoretic fundamental of finite element method (FEM) to build accurate model for simulating the
thermal-mechanical stress in a complicated 3D IC structure with TSVs. Given a thermal distribution
data of a IC layout, we can simulate its related stress information accurately via FEM based models.
However, this method is quite computational expensive, which make it not practical to apply
such methods to runtime analysis of 3D IC reliability.

\section{Fully Connected Artificial Neural Networks}

Artificial neural networks (ANNs) or connectionist systems are a computational model used in machine learning, 
computer science and other research disciplines, which is based on a large collection of connected simple units called artificial neurons, 
loosely analogous to axons in a biological brain\cite{kohonen1988introduction}.
Based on
