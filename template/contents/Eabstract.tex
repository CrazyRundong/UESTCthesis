Equipping with 3rd dimension stack realized by though silicon vias (TSV),
3D IC is a novel technology to address the neutral drawbacks of traditional IC,
and improves it integration capabilities.
However, duo to the limitation to heat elimination of 3rd dimension stack,
thermal stress appears around TSVs. This is a negative impact to system reliability.
Given a stress value, dynamic thermal management (DTM) could release this stress.
Traditional methods for calculating stress value is computational expensive,
which makes runtime DTM impossible.

A new deep learning based method of approximating the thermal stress is proposed in this work.
Given temperature distribution around TSV, a stress value could be evaluated in runtime.
This makes runtime DTM, which will improve system reliability, possible.
